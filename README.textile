h1. RNASeq pipeline

After cloning the repository, run the bootstrapping script to create the 
required Python environment:

bc. $ ./bootstrap.sh

There's no harm in accidentally running this script multiple times.

Next, edit @config.sample.yaml@ and save it as @config.yaml@. Now you can try
whether the configuration is in a good state:

bc. $ ./check.py

Or get more detailed information with:

bc. $ ./check.py --detailed
