RNASeq Pipeline Meeting 2014/04/29
----------------------------------

Sven, JÃ¶rg, Kristin, Christoph, Micha

Tasks:

- implement SLURM support <moved to AG>
- interactive tool to handle big config files might be helpful <least concern>
- add more options to steps with default values which may be adjusted by users
  (for example cufflinks), also add corresponding command line switches
- don't hard-code CPU & RAM requirements, both should be configurable per step
  - also define global CPU & RAM limits in the configuration
- don't hard-code modules, define which modules are required for which tool in
  the config
- status.py: add option to skip tool checking, find out why it's so slow (fstat?)
  <solved>
- are multiple output files per out/ connection possible?
  <yes>
- add ''-joined process args string to YAML log file to facilitate manual re-runs
  <should be output by option to status.py>
- is it possible to watch a processes' stderr while a step is running?
  - preferably not only if you launched in debug mode, but always, like inter-
  cepting write calls to the respective file descriptor
  - or maybe dump each monitored file's 1024 byte tail every once in a while 
  (this would be easiest and includes stdout and stderr)
- clean up in/ and out/ names - 'error', 'log', 'stderr' should in some cases
  become the same thing
  - we need a well-defined ontology of file types regardless of actual file
  type, more from the semantic perspective
- fix quoting in result graph rendering (when " appears in a command line, the 
  dot file gets messed up)
- add a random suffix to SGE's stdout and stderr log filenames
- information about created public_info should be better documented
  <documentation per step should be generally better>

Problems:
- if different sources contain identically named samples they are probably gone
  overwrite there output files handled wrong
  
Sequencing Workflows
====================

Reference Genome
----------------

* Genome Resequencing
** Variant Calling

* Methylome
** Specific alignment (Bisulfite converted bases)
** Methylation calling

* Transcriptome
** De-novo transcript assembly
** Counts per annotation
** Differential expression

* ChIP-seq
** aggregate to peaks
** peak calling (foreground vs background)

Non-reference Genome
--------------------

* Genome
** Genome Assembly

* Transcriptome
** Assemble Transcripts
