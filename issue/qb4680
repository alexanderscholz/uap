Summary: Add section to YAML for cluster config
Priority: 5

It is necessary to make the configuration for the cluster available from within the config file.
Therfore, we need a section/key in the config for global cluster configuration like:
* max-cores
* buffer-size (for dd)

A general step-specific cluster config would be also nice to have, like:
* 'cluster-submit-options' string per step
