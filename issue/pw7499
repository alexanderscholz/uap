Summary: Implement 'report' subcommand
Priority: 5

Steps that generate report data should also implement a report() function that generates report graphs.
Further thoughts about this are:
* write complete data as ggplot2 friendly easy to import text file
* register the created files to the runs like run.add_report_file()
* maybe generate reports for all runs of a step (visualisation might be cumbersome)
