Summary: Repair volatilize subcommand
Priority: 5

* volatilize does not correct schedule tasks for recomputation
** if two succeeding steps are volatilized
** and a non-finished step is added directly to the last volatilized step
** only the last volatilized step gets marked for recomputation instead of both steps

* Volatilize files/connections instead of steps
** that way one could keep small files with summary information and remove large files

* Which influence does the file tpe has on volatilization? What happens if a link becomes volatilized?
